![Julia Ebert]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/imgs/mountains.jpg){: .left}

I'm Julia Ebert, a second year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard. I work on bio-inspired swarm robotics in the [Self-Organizing Systems Research Group](https://ssr.seas.harvard.edu/) with Prof. Radhika Nagpal.

I am interested in robots for science. I certainly have no plans to build a robot army to take over the world, as the title of this blog makes abundantly clear.

I hold a BS in Behavioral Neuroscience from Northeastern University and an MRes in Bioengineering from Imperial College London. My research focused on understanding human motor control and learning, with an eye toward developing robotic assistance. I have received the Goldwater Scholarship, DAAD undergraduate scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, and am currently funded by the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.
